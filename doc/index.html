<h1>MakeGrid</h1>

<p>The MakeGrid application makes az/alt grids to use with TUI for collecting pointing data. <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/35m_operations/makeGrid/files">Download</a> a MacOS application, or run from source in tcc/utils/makeGrid/runMakeGrid.py.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Set the desired number of points and altitude range. You can usually leave the other settings alone.
    <li>Press Generate and wait while the grid is generated
    <li>Examine the grid to see if it is OK. If it has two points that are very near each other, then it is not OK. Press Generate to try again.
    <li>Once you like the grid, press Save to save it. TUI's Telescope:Pointing Data script looks for grid files in TUIAdditions/Grids, and you do not need to restart TUI to see new grid files (the script looks for grid files every time you click on the Grid menu).
    <li>You can also load existing grid files using Load, in case you want to examine the graph.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Change to a technique the concentrates points at the altitude boundaries, in order to cross lowest and highest magnesensors more often. Adde flag CoverHemisphere to generateGrid.py to control this.
